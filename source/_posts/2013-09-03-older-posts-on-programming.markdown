I started blogging on the excellent [wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) site almost 8 years back, and I used to post general musings almost weekly. In between, I also wrote some much appreciated (by friends and colleagues, that is) posts on programming.

Later, some time in 2011, I fell for the convenience of "publishing posts via emails" feature of [Posterous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous) and wrote a few posts there. Posterous, of course, shut down (taking my posts along with it though I have the backup) and I will have to republish them again to resurrect those posts.

And then finally, I fell in love with the simplicity and elegance of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and have been using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host my blog (that you are reading now).

Though I haven't been posting regularly off late, I thought it would be pertinent to link back to those old programming posts of mine, just to ensure there is a single point of access to all my technical writings. So, here goes:

[Programming archive on Wordpress](http://protoiyer.wordpress.com/category/programming/)

Programming archive on Posterous: will republish (maybe here itself) and add link(s)

That is it for now. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/protoiyer) as well where I tend to post a tad more frequently on all kinds of topics.
