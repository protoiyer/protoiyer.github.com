  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, on November 2, 2011, the awesome <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim text editor</a> turned 20 years old. Vim started its life, as many of you might be aware, as the clone or imitation of the venerable vi editor created by <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/">Bill Joy</a> &#8211; who went on to cofound Sun Microsystems &#8211; for Unix. It is a tribute to the genius of Bill Joy that his core ideas are kicking and thriving even 35 years after he created vi.</p>

<p>Vim was created by <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/vim.html">Bram Moolenar</a> to fill a necessity &#8211; the version of Unix OS he was working on couldn&#8217;t use vi (due to strict copyright of vi) and so Bram had the option of either using one of the existing clones (all of which, as per him, sucked) or port vi. He, luckily for the rest of us, opted for option 2 and the rest as they say is history.</p>

<p>My interest in Vim was piqued sometime during the last 3 years thanks to the programming blogs I was reading via Google Reader. However since there was this notion that it is hard to learn, and since the benefit was not that evident (unless you stick with it for at least 4-8 weeks doing programming or text editing), I never took it seriously.</p>

<p>The turning point, at least for me, was July 29, 2010 when I read two awesome posts on Vim that not just made me very interested, but also reassured that there perhaps is no just one way to learn to using Vim. The first post was by Yehuda Katz: <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">Everyone Who Tried to Convince Me to use Vim was Wrong</a>. The second was by Rob Conery, an ex-Microsoft guy: <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/thoughts/vim-is-your-daddy">Moving Your Mind Into Vim Mode</a>. In fact Rob wrote that after getting inspired by Yehuda&#8217;s post. And after a few weeks, when I read Steve Losh&#8217;s post <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">Coming Home to Vim</a>, I was certain this is a skill that I should master - some day. Of course, I should not forget to mention another post that really caught my attention, by Derick Bailey: <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2010/04/23/using-vim-as-your-c-code-editor-from-visual-studio/">Using Vim As Your C# Code Editor From Visual Studio</a></p>

<p>Some time during last August or September I did download and install Vim, opened it, and didn&#8217;t spend too much time with it before giving up on it. But I did try out the Vim Kata posted by Rob: <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2010/05/24/vim-kata-one">Vim Kata Number One</a>. I must admit I found the going a bit tough and that was one of the reasons for giving up. Plus, there was the Visual Studio editor beckoning me to go back and use it to &#8221;<a href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">rot my mind</a>&#8221; further, as Charles Petzold would say!</p>

<p>Anyways, long story short, I chickened out and didn&#8217;t take the time to learn or befriend Vim.</p>

<p>In 2011, I started focusing a lot on Ruby and Rails as the main programming platform. And no matter where I turn to, the default editor of choice in the Ruby and Rails world is Vim. I thought this was a good opportunity to at last start using and learn properly. During late February, I attended a Chennai Geeks session at ThoughtWorks, Chennai, by <a href="http://www.vagmim.com/">Vagmi Mudumbai</a> on Rails followed by <a href="http://siddhi.blogspot.com/">Siddharta Govindaraj</a> on Django. Both of them are craftsmen and great programmers and both of them were using Vim for their live coding. I was sort of sucked right in and blown away at the same time!</p>

<p>Over the last seven months, I have been doing all my programming work (and now even this blog post writing) on Vim. Whenever I switch to Gmail to compose a long mail, I miss the power of Vim. I must say that I am both lucky and thankful to have finally discovered the power and sheer joy of using Vim. It is after all the only editor that is guaranteed to be available on almost any system [vi comes pre-installed in the Unix family of Operating systems (Unix, Linux, Mac OSX). On Windows we can download and install it.].</p>

<p>If you are someone who writes text or code for a number of hours every day, learning Vim would be a gamechanger for you. I am still learning Vim and people who have been using it for 10 years say that they are still learning something new every day, and I think I am a long way away from mastery.</p>

<p>I will leave you with a few more great articles, some of which came out on the occassion of Vim&#8217;s 20th birthday:</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/11/two-decades-of-productivity-vims-20th-anniversary.ars">Two decades of productivity: Vim&#8217;s 20th anniversary</a></p>

<p>And last, but not the least, this awesome, inspiring story about how Mark Oâ€™Connor programs using just an iPad hooked to the cloud: <a href="http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">I swapped my MacBook for an iPad+Linode</a></p>

<p>Happy 20th birthday, Vim!</p>

<p>And Happy Vim-ing, friends!</p>

<p>PS: I haven&#8217;t gone into why Vim is great or how it will make you uber-productive. For that you can click through and read the mostly awesome posts I have linked to above :).</p>

<p>PS2: If you have ever used j/k or n/p in Gmail or Google Reader for navigation, you can thank Bill Joy and vi for that awesome experience!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week Google rolled out the redesign of my favorite Google product - <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a>. This was a much needed face-lift, no doubt &#8211; though I am not a fan of the new UI &#8211; and more importantly, from Google&#8217;s perspective, they were integrating one more service with <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a>, the future of Google. This was supposed to make Reader more social, but ironically, in a perplexing move (at least, from the perspective of power users of Google Reader), Google ended up making Reader a less social, and a less useful product overall.</p>

<p>I am not going into the details of how Google fared, and what they could have done better, as many more knowledgeable people have written about that, and I will link to some of them here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/11/02/the-google-reader-redesign-is-an-ugly-lonely-user-experience/">The Google Reader Redesign is an Ugly, Lonely User Experience</a> on Forbes</p>

<p><a href="http://kirbybits.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/wherein-i-try-to-explain-why-google-reader-is-the-best-social-network-created-so-far/">Wherein I try to explain why Google Reader is the best social network created so far</a> by Courtney Stanton</p>

<p><a href="http://binarybonsai.com/2011/11/02/the-google-reader-downgrade/">The Google Reader Downgrade</a> by Michael Heilemann</p>

<p>The biggest loss for me is the missing personal curated feed of items shared by awesome folks like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/jessestay">Jesse Stay</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/robdiana">Rob Diana</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/louisgray">Louis Gray</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/phil.ashman">Phil Ashman</a>, and closer home, folks like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/mahendrap">Mahendra Palsule</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/dhananjay.nene">Dhananjay Nene</a>, and last but not the least, my friends like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/arun.vydianathan">Arun</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/pradeepcr">Pradeep</a>.</p>

<p>I would rather read something that is read and shared by these folks than read some item popping up the stream from some source that I follow. Why? Because, I know that these guys had taken the time out to read something and found it worthwhile to share it. Also, when I want to search for something that I had seen/read in Reader, I mostly search Google Reader first, and only if I can&#8217;t find the relevant answer, do I resort to a generic Google search.</p>

<p>So, what was the way forward to get back the social aspect I lost? Well, as a first step, I remembered that I read in the morning what Alex had posted about <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/11/read-your-shared-items-in-google-reader.html">reclaiming your shared items</a> from inside the Reader. That was a first sigh of relief (I would have shared at least 500 items in the last 5 years and so getting that back intact was a big plus!). It then struck me that I can now recreate the shared items from the people I was following using the same technique.</p>

<p>For that, I had to first get hold of the list of people I used to follow. One can get that from &#8220;Settings | Import/Export&#8221; tab in the Reader, and from there I downloaded the JSON for the list of people that I follow. Though it contained some 50 names, only 10-20 were very important for me (those were the people who were into active reading and sharing on Reader).</p>

<p>I subscribed to their &#8220;thus-far&#8221; shared items (so that I can still do meaningful searches from within the Reader). Next, thanks to the suggestion from Phil, I followed the <a href="https://plus.google.com/110371866564374610674/posts/7YKJZjShCUF">steps outlined by Tony Scelfo</a> and ran the script he provided, that parsed the JSON and opened up Google+ profile for each of the users in the JSON. Yes, that opened about 50 tabs for me, and I had to close about 30, but I ended up with the 20 people whom I want to follow for their &#8220;shared&#8221; items. I added each of them to a new Google+ circle that I called &#8220;greader&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, most of them will not use Google Reader for sharing any more (or with the same intensity) as before, but at least I can easily keep abreast of both what they shared earlier, and what they choose to share publicly on Google+ from now on.</p>

<p>Of course, it would have been best if people taking decisions at Google were a bit more considerate, and had studied a little closer how power users were using the service. But, hey, at least I have something instead of nothing. And hopefully, in the next few months, Google would rethink/evolve the integration further and that might render my effort today a waste. But till then I have my personal shared items and those from my friends safe!</p>

<p>And, is there any silver lining? Yes, there is. First is the hope that someone in Google would listen to what I consider to be very genuine concerns of power users like me, and second is the fact that people like Dave Winer and Francis Cleary are working on making feed reading products better or making better products!</p>
